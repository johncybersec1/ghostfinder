# Ghost Finder

## Description
Discover available hosts in your network with Ghost Finder, a Python tool designed to simplify network exploration.

Ghost Finder empowers users to scan their network for active hosts swiftly. After entering the subnet mask, the tool tirelessly iterates through potential IP addresses, identifying active hosts using ICMP echo requests. Once the scan is complete, Ghost Finder displays a list of active hosts, enabling users to understand the network's topology more effectively.

While Ghost Finder provides valuable insights into network connectivity, it's crucial to remember its educational purpose. Users are encouraged to utilize comprehensive security tools like NMAP for vulnerability assessments and network security enhancements.
